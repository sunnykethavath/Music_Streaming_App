## Validation
```
To validate the input we get from client, we've used validation annotations that are used to enforce specific constraints on the values of the variables. These constraints ensure that the data input by the user is of the correct format and meets certain criteria.
* @Valid - In Spring Framework, the @Valid annotation is used in conjunction with @PostMapping and @PutMapping annotations, which are used to handle POST and PUT requests, respectively. When used with @PostMapping or @PutMapping, the @Valid annotation is typically applied to a method parameter annotated with @RequestBody.
* @NotEmpty: This annotation is used to validate that the annotated field is not null or empty.
* @NotNull: This annotation is used to validate that the annotated field is not null.
* @Max : This annotation is used to validate that the annotated field is not greater than the mentioned value in field.
* @Min : This annotation is used to validate that the annotated field is not smaller than the mentioned value in field.

## Data Flow
```
1. User send as a request to the application throgh the endpoints
2. the api recived request and sends it to the appropriate controll method
3. the controller method makes a call to the method in service class.
4. he controller method returns a response to the API
5. The API sends the response back to the user
```
## Api End Points
The following endpoints are available in the API:
* Admin Controller
```
POST/signUp/Admin : Register Admin

GET/playlists : Get all playlists

PUT/playlist/add/{playlistId} : Add song in playlist

DELETE/playlist/{id} : delete a playlist
```
## Data Structure Used

We have used Persistent database to implement CRUD Operations.
```
